CONVENTIONS:
Much of the DCT code in Psi was written in ways that made perfect sense at the same time, but no longer
do now. Here, we document some more esoteric conventions:
* The amplitudes are often written as Lambda (the 2RDM cumulant). This is perfectly reasonable for most
  implemented theories, but the amplitudes no longer match Lambda for ODC-13. Whether the amplitudes should
  match lambda depends on your ansatz. Choosing the ansatz is a matter of ongoing research.
* In the -06 theories, the intermediates d and tau are identical. Some variable names say one when they
  (properly speaking) mean the other.
